                    03 shadow dom
                    CSS scales scales pretty badly, because we constantly
                    need to make sure that the id's of all the elements
                    are unique and often CSS selectors can get pretty complex.
                    This is why many front-end frameworks offer some form
                    of encapsulation.

                    Children are wrapped in a shadow root, a special type of
                    DOM node which encapsulates the elements inside of it.
                    - Styles do not leak out
                    - Not possible to use a regular querySelector() to select
                      elements inside or outside the shadow root
